# Dave's Presentations

This is a simple GitHub repo to hold all the presentations I give at various
gatherings (typically [Python NW](http://pynw.org.uk/)). These are all as
public domain as I can make them (I've stuck them under the [CC0
License](LICENSE)) so feel free to remix, present them yourselves, or whatever
you like. But bear in mind this doesn't apply to the packages included in the
repo (deck.js, reveal.js, flowtime.js, etc.) - they've got their own licenses
which are included in the relevant sub-directories.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:dave@waveform.org.uk) with any questions,
comments, complaints about accuracy, etc. (many of these presentations are
probably quite dated by now!)


## How to View

The simplest way to view these is to clone the repo and just open the
index.html of the presentation in a browser. All links used are relative and
I've included all necessary libs and styles in the repo (not as submodules,
just straight copies to ensure future changes don't break stuff).

Alternatively, clone the repo to a web-server and you can view this stuff
over the web. Just such a clone can be viewed at:
