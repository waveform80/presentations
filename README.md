# Dave's Presentations

This is a simple GitHub repo to hold all the presentations I give at various
gatherings (typically [Python NW](http://pynw.org.uk/)). These are all as
public domain as I can make them (I've stuck them under the [CC0
License](LICENSE)) so feel free to remix, present them yourselves, or whatever
you like.

Oh, and feel free to [contact me](dave@waveform.org.uk) with any questions,
comments, complaints about accuracy, etc. (many of these presentations are
probably quite dated by now!).


## How to View

The simplest way to view these is to clone the repo and just open the
index.html of the presentation in a browser. All links used are relative and
I've included all necessary libs and styles in the repo (not as submodules,
just straight copies to ensure future changes don't break stuff).
