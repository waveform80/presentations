Dave's Presentations
====================

This is a simple GitHub repo to hold all the presentations I give at various
gatherings (typically [Python NW](pynw.org.uk)). These are all as public domain
as I can make them (I've stuck them under the [CC0 License](LICENSE)) so feel
free to remix, present them yourselves, or whatever you like.
