* Gtk (3) vs PyQt4/PySide
* Quick summary: Gtk's controls and abstractions rock but Glade is *awful*
* Reminiscences: Glade=MS Visual Studio, Qt4 Designer=Delphi
* Gtk framework is bloody annoying when it comes to getting references - either construct manually or make shit loads of builder.get_object() calls
* Gtk documentation is utterly shit compared to Qt's
* Gtk GUI designer (Glade) crashes like it's going out of fashion (6 times in a single hour?! For something as simple as moving a goddamn row in a table?!)
* That said, Gtk's underlying design - abstractions and what-not, rocks:
  - Compare Qt4's bizarre double-spinbox and spinbox but lack of double-slider to Gtk's abstraction of an "adjustment"
  - Demonstrate Glade vs Qt4 designer's tab order manipulation
  - Demonstrate Glade vs Qt4 designer's association of labels with controls
  - Demonstrate how to crash Glade really easily
* Gtk3 ... not on Windows yet (really cross platform? Erm not until you port it guys)
* PyQt4 vs PySide - licensing fun, but actually it's really easy to work with both
* It seems the windows community has already decided: Qt (Gtk's not included in the two major "feature-packed" distros: EPD and PythonXY)
* Personal whinges:
  - using Gtk means using Ubuntu's stupid thin scroll bars
  - Glade 2 and 3 - Glade 2 doesn't work on Ubuntu (at least from Unity - not Glade's fault - stupid packagers)
* Conclusion:
  - If Gtk fixed their bloody designer I'd support them whole-heartedly (despite the lack of everything else, Windows support et al)
  - But they don't support the users (no windows support) or the developers (no decent docs, no working glade), so screw it
  - Not to mention they keep changing everything in horribly incompatible ways and not documenting it
  - In other words, they're a bunch of bloody minded purists ... not at all like me ... ahem
