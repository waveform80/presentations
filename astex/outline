* Remember ElementTreeFactory?
* Quick recap... make code that produces a document match the *structure* of the document
* Remember one of the strengths of ElementTreeFactory? Sub-class it and override to custom the output
* Could we make it produce LaTeX instead?
* Well ... erm ... no
* But we could write a set of classes that look more or less like ElementTreeFactory which *do* produce LaTeX
* Introducing AsTeX - it's like ElementTreeFactory but for LaTeX (and XML - ahem)
* Horribly specific to a particular problem domain but probably simple to customize for others (he says without having actually tried it)
* Produces very nice PDFs as a result, including :
  - TOCs
  - indexes
  - left/right margins
  - syntax highlighted code
  - fancy tables (in several styles! oooooh!)
* Also capable of producing a very readable XML markup which reflects the TeX document structure
* Download it today kids! Well ... once I've gotten off my ass and packaged it anyway ... anyone actually interested in this shit?
